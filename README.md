# PytBit: The Next-Gen Python-Powered Blockchain

## Introduction
Welcome to PytBit, where Python meets blockchain in a revolutionary way. The PytBit ecosystem combines the flexibility and ease-of-use of Python with the robustness and security of blockchain technology, aiming to solve critical issues that have plagued existing blockchain implementations.

## Features and Innovations

- **Dynamic Token Minting**: PytBit incorporates dynamic token minting, adjusting the rate of new tokens based on block complexity and network demand.
- **Scalability & Efficiency**: The architecture allows for rapid transaction processing and accommodates a growing number of nodes.
- **Eco-Friendly**: PytBit employs proof-of-stake (PoS) and other energy-efficient consensus algorithms, making it a green blockchain solution.
- **Interoperable & Extensible**: It's designed to interact seamlessly with other blockchains and can be easily extended with Python libraries and modules.
- **Smart Contract in Python**: Write and deploy smart contracts using Python, opening up blockchain development to the vast Python community.
- **Enhanced Security Protocols**: Multi-layered security protocols including two-factor authentication (2FA) for high-value transactions.

## Economic Model

- **Initial Supply**: 44 Million
- **Maximum Supply**: 88 Million
- **Dynamic Minting**: Aligned with Bitcoin's block complexity.
- **Halving Events**: In sync with Bitcoin's halving events.
- **Burn & Rewards**: Periodic token burns and staking rewards for sustainability.

## Governance & Community

- **Decentralized Governance**: Token holders can participate in governance decisions, from protocol upgrades to feature enhancements.
- **Community-Driven**: A strong focus on community engagement, transparency, and open-source development.

## Modules

- **core_blockchain.py**: Handles basic blockchain operations.
- **token_management.py**: Manages the life cycle of tokens.
- **smart_contract.py**: Allows for Python-based smart contracts.
- **security_protocols.py**: Manages security features like 2FA.
- **network_management.py**: Handles node registration and network updates.
