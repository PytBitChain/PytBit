# PytBit Tokenomics

## Crafting a Balanced and Sustainable Economic Model

Welcome to the economic engine that powers the PytBit ecosystem. The PytBit token is not merely a cryptocurrency; it's a testament to the robust and sustainable economic model we've built to ensure stability, growth, and prosperity for all participants in the PytBit network.

### 🌐 Initial and Max Supply

- **Initial Supply**: 22 Million Tokens
- **Max Supply**: 44 Million Tokens

The initial supply ensures that the market is not oversaturated, while the max supply provides a cap that guarantees scarcity and value appreciation over time.

### 🔄 Halving Mechanism

Our unique halving mechanism is designed to control the supply of PytBit tokens meticulously, ensuring sustainability and scarcity. The rewards for mining and transactions will undergo a halving process, which will occur at predetermined intervals, ensuring a gradual decrease in token production and rewarding early adopters and participants.

### 🔥 Strategic Burn Policy

To further ensure the value and scarcity of the PytBit token, a strategic burn policy will be implemented. Token burning will occur under specific circumstances and events, reducing the overall circulating supply and creating an environment conducive to value appreciation.

### 🏦 Distribution

- **Development Fund**: XX%
- **Community Rewards**: XX%
